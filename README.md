An implementation of "Community preserving adaptive graph convolutional networks for link prediction in attributed networks" (IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems)

Note that it should install Deep Graph Library (DGL) https://www.dgl.ai/ before running. To test it quickly, you can directly use network datasets of DGL like this:
